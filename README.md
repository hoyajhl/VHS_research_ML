## Analysis Flow in this project

We adopted SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) in order to solve Class Imbalanced problems in our data. 
After constructing new data with this technique, 
we compared the performeace of prediction according to different types of Machine Learning models. 

ML Model comparison 
-Traditional ML model : Linear regression, SVM, Naive Bayes 
-Bagging- RF model
-Boosting- XGB, LGBM, CatBoost

After comparing our ML models, 
we used feature selection among radiomics variables(pet1, pet2) to evaluate importance of our predcition

DeLong test: Auc Comparison and p-vlaue were considered - Using R software
Research Thesis Link: currently working on it
